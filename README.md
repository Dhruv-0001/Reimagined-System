## PROJECTS :

 ## 2) AUTOMATION USING MINDSPHERE-

 DEPLOYING AN APP ON THE MINDSPHERE WHICH IS THE CLOUD SERVICE OF SIEMENS BASED ON INTERNET OF THINGS. MINDCONNECT IOT MODULE WAS USED FOR CREATING AN API WHICH TRANSFERS THE DATA FROM THE PLC TO THE APP. THUS APP CAN BE USED TO REMOTELY CONTROL THE WORKING OF THE LABS, THUS AUTOMATING THEM.
