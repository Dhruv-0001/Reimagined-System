# Reimagined-System
This is my Internship project report which includes the project on automation using Mindsphere.

### Internship project report

- This repository showcases my work during my Internship at Siemens.

### Projects :
- I was a trainee in the R&D department. My work is basically divided into two projects- 

### 1) Programming of labs-
 
- PLC Programming of the existing labs in the department on Logo and TIA portal software.

### 2) Automation using Mindsphere -

- Deploying an app on the mindsphere which is the cloud service of Siemens based on internet of things. 
- Mindconnect IOT module was used for creating an api which transfers the data from the plc to the app.
- Thus app can be used to remotely control the working of the labs, thus automating them.
